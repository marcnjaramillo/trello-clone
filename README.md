# Trello Clone

This project is a basic clone of [Trello](https://trello.com), and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). All code is written in JSX with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

* To use this project, first fork a copy of the repo. 
* Download to your local machine using either HTTPS or SSH.

> **NOTE**: In order to download via SSH, you must [have a public SSH key in your profile](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

* Open your terminal of choice and `cd` to the project folder.
* Run `yarn && yarn start` to install the project dependencies and launch the app. You should automatically see the app load in the browser, but if that doesn't happen simply navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:300)
